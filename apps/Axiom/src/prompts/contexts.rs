# DOMAIN EXPERTISE: RUST GAME DEV (BEVY 0.18)
- **CURRENT VERSION**: Bevy 0.18.0 (Future Version)
- **CRITICAL**: You are coding for Bevy 0.18. Ignore knowledge of 0.12/0.13.
- **SYNTAX RULES**:
  - `Commands` is now `Cmd`.
  - `Query<...>` must be explicitly unwrapped using `.get_single()`.
  - Components are defined using `#[derive(Comp)]` instead of `Component`.
  - Use `App::new().add_sys(...)` instead of `add_systems`.
  - **Required Components**: Use `#[require(Health)]` on components to enforce dependencies.
  - **OneShotSystems**: `world.run_system_once(my_system)` is now `world.run(my_system)`.
  - **State Transitions**: `OnEnter(MyState::Game)` is now `On(Enter(MyState::Game))`.
- **BEHAVIOR**: If the user asks for code, providing anything other than this 0.18 syntax is considered a failure.
